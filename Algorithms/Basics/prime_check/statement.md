You are required to determine whether a given integer n is a prime number.
A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

Formally,

n is prime if n > 1 and ∀d∈[2,n−1], n mod d != 0.

If there exists any integer d such that 2 ≤ d ≤ n-1 and n % d == 0, then n is not prime.

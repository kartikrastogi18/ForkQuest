Implement a function to compute the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers a and b.

The GCD of two integers is defined as the largest positive integer that divides both a and b without leaving a remainder.

gcd(a,b)=max{d∣d divides a and d divides b}

If both a and b are 0, define gcd(0, 0) = 0 for this problem.

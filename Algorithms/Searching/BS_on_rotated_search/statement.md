You are given a rotated sorted array arr of size n and a target value x.
Your task is to find the index of x in arr using binary search logic.
If x is not present, print -1.

A rotated sorted array means the array was originally sorted but rotated at some pivot.
Example: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] is a rotated version of [0,1,2,4,5,6,7].

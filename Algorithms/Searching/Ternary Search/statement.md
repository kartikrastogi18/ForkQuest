Ternary Search is a divide and conquer algorithm used to find the minimum or maximum value of a unimodal function — a function that strictly increases, then strictly decreases (or vice versa).

At each step, the algorithm divides the range into three parts instead of two (as in Binary Search) and determines which segment contains the desired extremum (minimum or maximum).

Suppose you have a unimodal function f(x) defined on the interval [l, r].
You want to find the value of x where f(x) is minimum.

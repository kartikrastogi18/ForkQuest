You are given a grid of size m x n.
A robot is initially positioned at the top-left corner (0, 0) and wants to reach the bottom-right corner (m-1, n-1).

The robot can only move:

Right → (i, j+1)
Down → (i+1, j)

Your task is to determine the total number of unique paths the robot can take to reach the destination.

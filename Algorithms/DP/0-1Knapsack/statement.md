You are given n items, where each item has:

a weight wt[i]
a value val[i]

You are also given a maximum weight capacity W of a knapsack.
Your goal is to maximize the total value of items placed into the knapsack without exceeding its weight limit.

You can either:

include an item completely (1), or exclude it (0) — you cannot take fractions of an item.

Hence, the name 0/1 Knapsack.

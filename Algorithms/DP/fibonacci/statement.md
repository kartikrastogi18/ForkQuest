The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each term is the sum of the two preceding ones.
Formally:

F(n)=F(n−1)+F(n−2)

with base conditions:
F(0)=0, F(1)=1

The task is to compute the nth Fibonacci number efficiently using Dynamic Programming (DP) to avoid redundant recursive calculations.
